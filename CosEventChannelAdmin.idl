//OMG regularly publishes a summary file that contains all the "code" parts of 
//an OMG formal document. Every formal document line that is IDL, PIDL, or 
//language code is included in the summary file. The reason for such a listing 
//is to give readers an electronic version of the "code" so that they can 
//extract pieces of it. Readers might want to test an example, include it in 
//their own code, or use it for documentation purposes. Having the code lines 
//available electronically means there is less likelihood of a transcription 
//error.
